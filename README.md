most simple interpreter i can make first

yooki: a language named after my cat (yuki), that hasn't been made yet

currently can only evaluate simple one line expressions (with limited parentheses and division)

will work through bugs and address next two steps:
    1. multiline evaluation (stack approach)
    2. lexing tokenized expressions
